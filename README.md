# powershell-tutorial
Programs written to teach myself Windows PowerShell.

# Objective
Windows Powershell was created by Microsoft for system administration, but it can also be used for programming basic algorithms.
My idea was that if I can do progressively difficult algorithms written in PowerShell, I would be able to more easily use it for system administration. 

So far, so good.
